## <strong> Features </strong> ##
• Utilizes a Data Dictionary.
• Builds a Recommendation System model using different techniques to predict ratings and recommend businesses to users.
• Compares different models based on various performance metrics and choose the optimal.
• Content-based recommendation systems use the features of the item (and/or users) provided in the dataset.
• We have applied Tokenization, Stopword Filtering, Stemming to preprocess the text data. 
• Further, the TF-IDF vectorizer is used to create vectors from the text. 
• We found that almost 20% of users have rated the businesses either 1 or 2. 
• Amazon can improvise their Recommendation Systems to suggest relevant businesses for users, enhance customer satisfaction, and grow the orders created.
• The high sparsity of the user-item interaction matrix means that there is good scope to use a personalized Recommender System to suggest a new business the user has likely not interacted with before and will likely appreciate and avail of their service.
• It has been observed that the tuned User-User Collaborative Filtering-based model is giving the best performance based on RMSE, MAE, and NMAE.
• The company can use Item-Item Collaborative Filtering to make personalized business recommendations in order increase customer engagement as well as satisfaction.
